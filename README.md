:: binary-excursions
a research project into:
 elf/binary files
 machinecode (x86_64)
 x64 assembly
 memory/cpu interactions
 system programming (x86_64 systems)

What this is not:
documentation on the above. These are personal research notes and projects from a hobbyist. I wont go deep into all the ELF header fields, or all the data structures required to initialise your computer systems. I just pick out topics i find interesting
and try to share my insights on these topics.

Code examples, data and research notes, and hopefuly eventually this will grow into articles with code examples and a place for people to learn about and start their journey into the dungeons of computing, the invisible layers which make computing as powerful (jokes :'D... *tries not to cry*) and insecure as it is today.
