"And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it." - Roald Dahl

a research project trying to shed light on the dark dungeons of low level x86/64 computing.
Here i try to give some structure to and complete my knowledge of this art, and once i have a more structured view on this topic notes and resources and code examples will be compiled into articles to try and teach people about the esoteric arts of binary and assembly fu.

Some topics i'm interested in and will be touching:
>> system programming
>> * bootloader development
>> * kernel / os development
>> * BIOS development
>> * firmware

>> general programming
>> * kernel vs user space
>> * linux
>> * memory management
>> * assembly (x86_64)
>> * c

>> advanced programming
>> * poly/metamorphism
>> * self modifying / compiling code
>> * debuggers/compilers/assemblers
>> * domain specific languages
>> * interpreters / emulators
>> * security research (fuzzers / exploits / fun)

Some of the topics here might grow into their own projects, you can view this project as my scratch pad.
Feel free to steal my code, just be aware i'm not a proffessional and will probarbly break your shit if you don't understand what you are copying. I'm not responsible for your laziness, nor your assumptions on what my code is doing.
