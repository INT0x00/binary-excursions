Here are some fine resources found across the net on assembly, x86_64 architecture, and other interesting topics which are essential
to understanding binary information, files, memory, cpu cycles and all that jazz...

I will try to structure and sort this as i add more resources.

PEOPLE:
http://z0mbie.daemonlab.org/  <-- Z0mbie: One of the more creative and knowledable people in this field. 
                                          Read his articles if you know what is good for you!
https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax <-- Brilliant mind, creator of movfuscator and cantor dust and a lot of other cool tools. 
                                    Shares good knowledge about low level architectural issues and quircks.
http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/teaching/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf <-- OS development tutorial pdf by Nick Blundell                             
vxheaven.org/                 <-- VX Heaven: A virus creator community with a lot of interesting sources and insights.
IRC                           <-- Chat protocol / networks, old, but gold. A lot of good communities and channels with people.
                                  Any popular server will have #virus #assembly channels where people lurk around
                                  and exchange information.
wiki.osdev.org                <--- Operating system development community.
https://invisiblethingslab.com/itl/Welcome.html <-- really nice group working on Qubes OS and secure computing. They
                                                    publish a lot of nice blog posts and information about intel
                                                    artchitecture and low level goodness. Also, try Qubes, it's cool! ;D
